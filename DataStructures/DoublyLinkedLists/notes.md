Insertion -> O(1)
- same as singly linked list

Removal -> O(1)
- better than singly linked list
    - if remove from end of singly linked list, it's O(n) b/c must iterate through whole list

Searching/Accessing -> O(n)
    - O(n/2) b/c start at either end and work towards middle
        - gets simplified to O(n)


Takes up more MEMORY than singly linked list b/c there's the extra 'previous' pointer!!
