Bubble Sort
- Worse case and Average Time complexity => O(n**2)
- Best case time complexity => O(n) (w/sorted or almost sorted data b/c has very few swaps)
- Space complexity => O(1)

Insertion Sort
- Worse case and Average Time complexity => O(n**2)
- Best case time complexity => O(n) (w/sorted or almost sorted data b/c has very few swaps)
- Space complexity => O(1)

Selection Sort
- Worse case and Average Time complexity => O(n**2)
- Best case time complexity => O(n**2) (w/sorted or almost sorted data still have to go through each time to find lowest item)
- Space complexity => O(1)
