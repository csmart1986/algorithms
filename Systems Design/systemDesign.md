System Design = create a system based on a user prompt

DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS

1. Foundational knowledge
 - Ex: client server model, ntwork protocol

2. Key characteristics of a system
 - things you want the system to have
 - things you may be trading off when making certain design decisions
 - Ex: availability, latency, throughput, consistency, redundancy

3. Actual components of a system
 - more tangible things you can have or implement in the system
 - these allow you to have your key characteristics
 - Ex: load balancers, proxies, caches, rate limiting, leader election

4. Actual tech
 - real product or services that you can actually use in a system either as an actual component or to acheive a certain characteristic in a system
 - Ex: Zookeeper, Engine X, Reddis, Google cloud storage
